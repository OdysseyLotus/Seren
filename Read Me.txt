Well, hello there! I see you are looking through the files my mod. Go right ahead, of course, I'm not your mom. But I wanted to say that
you're probably going to see a bunch of things that I was too lazy to remove when uploading the mod, like WIP art assets and so on.
Nothing too spectacular, but you'll get a sneak peek into what's to come/what I'm working on, so that's kinda neat.

If you are creating a mod or translation or something for this mod, thank you so much! I really appreciate you taking the time to do that!

If you are looking at this mod with the hopes of creating a similar alien race mod, godspeed. I have labeled a bunch of things in the files,
but if you want a more in-depth explanation, please feel free to message me on Discord (NostalgicPoet#4502). Just be sure to mention what
you are messaging about in your first few messages, otherwise I'll ignore it. I say this because while the Humanoid Alien Races mod wiki
does detail a lot, it does not go nearly in-depth into all the things that you can actually do. I would also recommend that you visit the
Alien Races Modding Discord (http://discord.gg/XMCRj46) for more help.

This probably doesn't even matter, and this probably isn't what I should put in a Read Me, but whatever. I hope that I can help anyone with
a good idea that wants to mod.
